### Prerequistes:

Everyone is welcome!
All learners are welcome to take the foundations course, but completion of a beginning level programming course is recommended to fully engage in all of the coursework. If you want to brush up on your Python skills, we encourage you to review our free Introduction to Python course.

Learn More About Machine Learning
We encourage you to dive deeper in to machine learning with our Intro to Machine Learning and Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch courses.

Both courses are FREE and will help you be even better prepared to take the end-of-course assessment.
