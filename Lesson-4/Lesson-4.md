#### Why Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming, which is the programming style you most likely first learned. 
As you'll see in this lesson,
* object-oriented programming allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time;
* object-oriented programs hide the implementation from the end-user.

Consider Python packages like Scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. These are all Python packages built with object-oriented programming. 
Scikit-learn, for example, is a relatively large and complex package built with object-oriented programming. This package has expanded 
over the years with new functionality and new algorithms.

When you train a machine learning algorithm with Scikit-learn, you don't have to know anything about how the algorithms work or 
how they were coded. You can focus directly on the modeling.

Here's an example taken from the [Scikit-learn website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html):

```python
from sklearn import svm
X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
y = [0, 1]
clf = svm.SVC()
clf.fit(X, y) 
```
How does Scikit-learn train the SVM model? You don't need to know because the implementation is hidden with object-oriented programming. 
If the implementation changes, you as a user of Scikit-learn might not ever find out. Whether or not you SHOULD understand
how SVM works is a different question.

In this lesson, you'll practice the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. By the end of the lesson, you'll have built a Python 
package using object-oriented programming.

### 2. Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming

#### Objects are defined by characteristics and actions
Here is a reminder of what is a characteristic and what is an action.

#### Characteristics and Actions in English Grammar
Another way to think about characteristics and actions is in terms of English grammar. A characteristic would be a noun. On the other hand, an action would be a verb.

Let's pick something from the real-world: a dog. A few characteristics could be the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. What actions would a dog take? A dog can bark, run, bite and eat. These are all verbs.

### 3. Class, object, method, attribute

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary

* class - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes
* object - an instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc. However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.
* attribute - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.
* method - an action that a class or object could take
* OOP - a commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming
* encapsulation - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

In English, you might hear an attribute described as a property, description, feature, quality, trait, or characteristic. All of these are saying the same thing.

Here is a reminder of how a class, object, attributes and methods relate to each other.

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming Syntax

In this lesson, you'll see what a class and object look like in Python. In the next section, you'll have the chance to play around with the code. And then you will write your own class.

#### Function vs Method

A function and a method look very similar. They both use the def keyword. They also have inputs and return outputs. The difference is that a method is inside of a class whereas a function is outside of a class.

#### What is self?

If you instantiate two objects, how does Python differentiate between these two objects?

```python
shirt_one = Shirt('red', 'S', 'short-sleeve', 15)
short_two = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 20)
```
That's where `self` comes into play. If you call the `change_price` method on shirt_one, how does Python know to change the price of shirt_one and not of shirt_two?

`shirt_one.change_price(12)`

Behind the scenes, Python is calling the `change_price` method:

```python
def change_price(self, new_price):
   self.price = new_price
```
`Self` tells Python where to look in the computer's memory for the shirt_one object. And then Python changes the price of the shirt_one object. When you call the `change_price` method, `shirt_one.change_price(12)`, `self` is implicitly passed in.

The word `self` is just a convention. You could actually use any other name as long as you are consistent; however, you should always use `self` rather than some other word or else you might confuse people.

### 6. Notes about OOP:

#### Set and Get methods
The last part of the video mentioned that accessing attributes in Python can be somewhat different than in other programming languages like Java and C++. This section goes into further detail.

The shirt class has a method to change the price of the shirt: `shirt_one.change_price(20)`. In Python, you can also change the values of an attribute with the following syntax:

```python
shirt_one.price = 10
shirt_one.price = 20
shirt_one.color = 'red'
shirt_one.size = 'M'
shirt_one.style = 'long_sleeve'
```
This code accesses and changes the price, color, size and style attributes directly. Accessing attributes directly would be frowned upon in many other languages but not in Python. Instead, the general object-oriented programming convention is to use methods to access attributes or change attribute values. These methods are called set and get methods or setter and getter methods.

A get method is for obtaining an attribute value. A set method is for changing an attribute value. If you were writing a Shirt class, the code could look like this:

```python
class Shirt:

    def __init__(self, shirt_color, shirt_size, shirt_style, shirt_price):
        self._price = shirt_price

    def get_price(self):
      return self._price

    def set_price(self, new_price):
      self._price = new_price
```
Instantiating and using an object might look like this:

```python
shirt_one = Shirt('yellow', 'M', 'long-sleeve', 15)
print(shirt_one.get_price())
shirt_one.set_price(10)
```
In the class definition, the underscore in front of price is a somewhat controversial Python convention. In other languages like C++ or Java, price could be explicitly labeled as a private variable. This would prohibit an object from accessing the price attribute directly like `shirt_one._price = 15`. However, Python does not distinguish between private and public variables like other languages. Therefore, there is some controversy about using the underscore convention as well as get and set methods in Python. Why use get and set methods in Python when Python wasn't designed to use them?

At the same time, you'll find that some Python programmers develop object-oriented programs using get and set methods anyway. Following the Python convention, the underscore in front of price is to let a programmer know that price should only be accessed with get and set methods rather than accessing price directly with `shirt_one._price`. However, a programmer could still access _price directly because there is nothing in the Python language to prevent the direct access.

To reiterate, a programmer could technically still do something like `shirt_one._price = 10`, and the code would work. But accessing price directly, in this case, would not be following the intent of how the Shirt class was designed.

One of the benefits of set and get methods is that, as previously mentioned in the course, you can hide the implementation from your user. Maybe originally a variable was coded as a list and later became a dictionary. With set and get methods, you could easily change how that variable gets accessed. Without set and get methods, you'd have to go to every place in the code that accessed the variable directly and change the code.

You can read more about get and set methods in Python on this [Python Tutorial site](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php).

### A Note about Attributes
There are some drawbacks to accessing attributes directly versus writing a method for accessing attributes.

In terms of object-oriented programming, the rules in Python are a bit looser than in other programming languages. As previously mentioned, in some languages, like C++, you can explicitly state whether or not an object should be allowed to change or access an attribute's values directly. Python does not have this option.

Why might it be better to change a value with a method instead of directly? Changing values via a method gives you more flexibility in the long-term. What if the units of measurement change, like the store was originally meant to work in US dollars and now has to handle Euros? Here's an example:

#### Example Dollars versus Euros
If you've changed attribute values directly, you'll have to go through your code and find all the places where US dollars were used, like:

`shirt_one.price = 10 # US dollars`

and then manually change to Euros

`shirt_one.price = 8 # Euros`
If you had used a method, then you would only have to change the method to convert from dollars to Euros.


```python
def change_price(self, new_price):
    self.price = new_price * 0.81 # convert dollars to Euros

shirt_one.change_price(10)
```
For the purposes of this introduction to object-oriented programming, you will not need to worry about updating attributes directly versus with a method; however, if you decide to further your studies of object-oriented programming, especially in another language such as C++ or Java, you'll have to take this into consideration.

#### Modularized Code
Thus far in the lesson, all of the code has been in Jupyter Notebooks. For example, in the previous exercise, a code cell loaded the Shirt class, which gave you access to the Shirt class throughout the rest of the notebook; however, if you were developing a software program, you would want to modularize this code.

You would put the Shirt class into its own Python script called, say, shirt.py. And then in another Python script, you would import the Shirt class with a line like: `from shirt import Shirt`.

For now, as you get used to OOP syntax, you'll be completing exercises in Jupyter notebooks. But midway through the lesson, you'll modularize object-oriented code into separate files.

### 8. Commenting Object-Oriented Code

Did you notice anything special about the answer key in the previous exercise? The Pants class and the SalesPerson class contained docstrings! A docstring is a type of comment that describes how a Python module, function, class or method works. Docstrings, therefore, are not unique to object-oriented programming. This section of the course is merely reminding you to use docstrings and to comment your code. It's not just going to help you understand and maintain your code. It will also make you a better job candidate.

From this point on, please always comment your code. Use both in-line comments and document level comments as appropriate.

Check out this [link](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) to read more about docstrings.

#### Docstrings and Object-Oriented Code

Below is an example of a class with docstrings and a few things to keep in mind:

Make sure to indent your docstrings correctly or the code will not run. A docstring should be indented one indentation underneath the class or method being described.
You don't have to define 'self' in your method docstrings. It's understood that any method will have self as the first method input.

```python
class Pants:
    """The Pants class represents an article of clothing sold in a store
    """

    def __init__(self, color, waist_size, length, price):
        """Method for initializing a Pants object

        Args: 
            color (str)
            waist_size (int)
            length (int)
            price (float)

        Attributes:
            color (str): color of a pants object
            waist_size (str): waist size of a pants object
            length (str): length of a pants object
            price (float): price of a pants object
        """

        self.color = color
        self.waist_size = waist_size
        self.length = length
        self.price = price

    def change_price(self, new_price):
        """The change_price method changes the price attribute of a pants object

        Args: 
            new_price (float): the new price of the pants object

        Returns: None

        """
        self.price = new_price

    def discount(self, percentage):
        """The discount method outputs a discounted price of a pants object

        Args:
            percentage (float): a decimal representing the amount to discount

        Returns:
            float: the discounted price
        """
        return self.price * (1 - percentage)
  ```

### 9. Gaussian Class

#### Resources for Review

The example in the next part of the lesson assumes you are familiar with Gaussian and binomial distributions.

Here are a few formulas that might be helpful:

   * [Binomial Distributions Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution)

#### Further Resources

If you would like to review the Gaussian (normal) distribution and binomial distribution, here are a few resources:

This free Udacity course, [Intro to Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101), has a lesson on Gaussian distributions as well as the Binomial distribution.

This free course, [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827), also has a Gaussian distributions lesson.

### 10. How the Gaussian Class works - Exercise

### 12. Magic Methods - Exercise

### 14. Inheritance - Exercise

### 18. Advanced OOP Topics

Inheritance is the last object-oriented programming topic in the lesson. Thus far you've been exposed to:

   * classes and objects
   * attributes and methods
   * magic methods
   * inheritance
   
Classes, object, attributes, methods, and inheritance are common to all object-oriented programming languages.

Knowing these topics is enough to start writing object-oriented software. What you've learned so far is all you need to know to complete this OOP lesson. However, these are only the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

Here is a list of resources for advanced Python object-oriented programming topics.

   * [class methods, instance methods, and static methods](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/) - these are different types of methods that can be accessed at the class or object level
   * [class attributes vs instance attributes](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_class_and_instance_attributes.php) - you can also define attributes at the class level or at the instance level
   * [multiple inheritance, mixins](https://easyaspython.com/mixins-for-fun-and-profit-cb9962760556) - A class can inherit from multiple parent classes
   * [Python decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) - Decorators are a short-hand way for using functions inside other functions
