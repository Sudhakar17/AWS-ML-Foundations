### 1. Introduction

Welcome To Software Engineering Practices Part I

In this lesson, you'll learn about the following practices of software engineering and how they apply in data science.

* Writing clean and modular code
* Writing efficient code
* Code refactoring
* Adding meaningful documentation
* Using version control

In the lesson following this one (Part II) you'll also learn these software engineering practices:

* Testing
* Logging
* Code reviews


### 2. Clean and Modular Code

* PRODUCTION CODE: software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note this is different from production quality code, which describes code that meets expectations in reliability, efficiency, etc., for production. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.

* CLEAN: readable, simple, and concise. A characteristic of production quality code that is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.

* MODULAR: logically broken up into functions and modules. Also an important characteristic of production quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable.

* MODULE: a file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.
